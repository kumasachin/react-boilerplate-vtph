# Project Guidelines

## What We're Building

This is a React starter template with:

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for builds
- Vitest + Playwright for testing
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- Zustand for state
- Styled Components for styling

## How We Code

### Components

- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Tests for everything
- Accessibility built-in

### State

- Zustand for global state
- useState for local component state
- Keep it simple

### Testing

- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Test user behavior, not implementation

### Code Style

- ESLint + Prettier handle formatting
- TypeScript strict mode
- Keep it readable

- Use Apollo Client for GraphQL operations
- Create typed queries and mutations
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Test with screen readers
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
